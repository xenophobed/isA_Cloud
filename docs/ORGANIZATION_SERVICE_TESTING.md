# Organization Service Testing Documentation

## Service Overview

The Organization Service is a comprehensive microservice for managing organizations, members, roles, and multi-tenant functionality. It provides organization management, member management, context switching, and usage tracking capabilities.

**Service Information:**
- Port: 8212 (direct), Gateway routing: NOT CONFIGURED
- Version: 1.0.0
- Type: Organization management microservice
- Database: PostgreSQL (dev schema)

## Gateway Integration Status

### ❌ Gateway Routing Issue
**Issue:** Organization service is not configured in the gateway's static routing table.

**Current Static Routes:**
- users, accounts, auth, agents, models, mcp

**Missing Route:** organization service

**Impact:** Service must be accessed directly on port 8212, not through gateway port 8000.

**Recommendation:** Add organization service to gateway proxy configuration.

## Direct Service Testing Results

All tests performed directly on organization service (http://localhost:8212)
